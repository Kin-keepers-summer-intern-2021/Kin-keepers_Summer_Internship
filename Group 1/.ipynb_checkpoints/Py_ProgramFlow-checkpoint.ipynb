We have one other major tool for controlling  program flow, which is repetition. In programming, we will use repetitive loops to execute the same code many times. This is called **iteration**. The most basic kind of iteration is the `while` loop. A `while` loop will keep executing so long as the condition after the `while` is `True`."
